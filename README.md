# Intro

This application aims to learn and explore Firebase and implement Jetpack features. I also use Compose, Compose Navigation, and MVVM architecture. I will keep adding features to this application whenever I am free. This application is separated into multiple modules and can also serve as a skeleton for those exploring multi-module architecture for their application. Maybe, I will focus on other projects as well.
